# Capstone-A

You will be the clinician MD dealing with the collection of the dataset from your Heart disease cohort.

## Results

You will first share with your colleagues (data-analyst and study-coordinator) the results on your first 20 patients [heart.csv](heart.csv).

Once they have done a bit of work on these first results, you will add the results of your second cohort of patients [heart2.csv](heart2.csv) (by updating the `heart.csv` file, you wouldn't want to have two data files in the main project's repository).

Also, don't forget to communicate them later the meaning of the different columns (see below). This will be part of the final manuscript (in the material, as a table).

#### Variable meaning
age: age in years
sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)
cp: chest pain type
trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
target: 1 or 0 (with or without heart disease)

## Contribution to manuscript 

You will also need to add the number of individuals and the number of patients with heart disease in the material section of the main's project article.

Last but no least, you will need need to correct the the manuscript in the introduction (correctlion highlited bellow):

>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in all areas of the world except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths **(32.1%)** in 2015, up from **12.3 million** (25.8%) in 1990. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females. Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In the United States 11% of people between **20** and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over **80** have CVD. The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80 while it is around 68 in the developing world. Diagnosis of disease typically occurs seven to ten years earlier in men as compared to women.

## Other
- Don't forget that you might not want to commit every files, for that the `.gitignore` file might be useful...
- Don't forget to update your author name and affiliation in the manuscript
